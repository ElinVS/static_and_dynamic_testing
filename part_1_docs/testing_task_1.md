### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python



class CardGame:

#missing def init function



  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
    else
      return False

#1st method check_for_ace: 
# - if statement operator should be == instead of =
# - missing colons after else

   

  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    return card
  else:
    return card2


#2nd method highest_card:
# - indentation error
# - should be def not dif
# - missing a comma between card1 and card2
# - first return should be card1


def cards_total(self, cards):
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total

#- total is not set to anything
# - The last word of the string of needs a space between the word and the quotation
